&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a PhD candidate working at the 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evolutionary and Population Biology Department within 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; University of Amsterdam.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  My work aims to understand how 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; population dynamics responds to landscape change, 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do so by modelling approaches. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My research line focusses on predator-prey 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dynamics in conservation biological control.
