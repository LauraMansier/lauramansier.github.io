&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a PhD candidate working at the [Evolutionary and Population Biology Department](https://ibed.uva.nl/content/research-departments/epb/epb.html) within the [Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics](https://ibed.uva.nl/), [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  My work aims to understand how population dynamics respond to landscape change, I do so by modelling approaches. My research line focusses on predator-prey dynamics in conservation biological control and, simultaneously, increasing biodiversity in agricultural landscapes.
