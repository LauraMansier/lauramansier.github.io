<img src="Pictures/Foto Laura 1.jpeg" align="left" width="200" height="100"> I am a PhD candidate working at the Evolutionary and Population Biology Department within the Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, University of Amsterdam.

My work aims to understand how population dynamics responds to landscape change, I do so by modelling approaches. My research line focusses on predator-prey dynamics in conservation biological control.
