&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a PhD candidate working at the Evolutionary and Population 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Biology Department within the Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dynamics, University of Amsterdam.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  My work aims to understand how population dynamics responds to 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; landscape change, I do so by modelling approaches. My research 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; line focusses on predator-prey dynamics in conservation biological 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; control.
