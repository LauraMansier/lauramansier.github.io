Last year has not been a great year politically and it made me and the people around me feel quite powerless. However, there are other ways to make an impact and one of my favourite ways will also make you money (yay). I am talking impact investing. Over the years I have gained knowledge and experience in various ways to invest that leaves a positive impact on this world. In the coming slides, I will discuss what I have found. My knowledge comes from experience, mutliple sources that I have used over the years and lately from the book 'Girls just wanna have impact funds' from female invest. I am definetely no expert but I hope this information is useful to you.
