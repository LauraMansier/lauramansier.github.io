&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My work aims to understand how population dynamics respond to landscape change, I do so by modelling approaches. My research line focusses on predator-prey dynamics in conservation biological control and, simultaneously, increasing biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, I am working on a model that can simulate the dynamics of flower feeding natural enemies that have a predatory larval phase (e.g. hoverflies) where they consume pest prey (e.g. aphids). This model enables us to study the impact of landscape changes and management techniques on pest densities in crops. Model results can be used to formulate recommendations for farmers and policy maker on optimal land-use and management techniques. These recommendations should contribute to more reliable natural pest control, a reduction in the use of pesticides, and an increase of farmland biodiversity.
